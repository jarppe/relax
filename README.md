# Relax

Relaxing animation inspired by [Project JDM on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@project_jdm).

I wanted to check how I could implement some of Project JDM animations. Implemented using [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/), visualizations are done using [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SVG), audio is played with [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/), audio samples are from [FreePats](https://freepats.zenvoid.org/).
